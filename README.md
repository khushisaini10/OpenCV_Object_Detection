# OpenCV Object Detection

An OpenCV-based object detection project capable of detecting objects from both live camera feed and pre-recorded video files. This project utilizes deep learning models and OpenCV to identify and classify objects in real-time.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Object Detection via Camera**: Detect objects in real-time using a live camera feed.
- **Object Detection via Video Files**: Perform object detection on pre-recorded video files from your device.
- **Customizable Model**: Uses pre-trained models like YOLO or SSD for detection.
- **Real-Time Bounding Boxes**: Display real-time bounding boxes around detected objects with confidence scores.
- **Multi-Class Object Detection**: Detect multiple object classes with labels (e.g., cars, people, animals, etc.).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `OpenCV` (for image and video processing)
  - `NumPy` (for matrix operations)
  - Pre-trained models (YOLO, SSD, or MobileNet)
- **Other Resources**:
  - `coco.names` (for class names)
  - Configuration and weight files for the chosen model (e.g., `yolov3.cfg` and `yolov3.weights`)
